My girlfriend got tired of arguing with assholes on reddit. This project hopes to make it easy to screen someone before you start a discussion. Check it out at [[http://www.redditscraper.co/][redditscraper.co]].

For a list of subreddits I consider sexist check out [[terrible.org][terrible.org]]

*** Todo:
- Measure racism
- Better interface
- Cross OS/Browser cleanup
- favicon
